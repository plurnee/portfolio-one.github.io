            <h1>Chillflix</h1>
            <p>Last week, my groupmates and I submitted a group website project in school. It's code was a combination of .ASP with c# and html with css and javascript. It was just a very basic website project and it was my first time designing a website again after many years have passed. But because of that small project, suddenly I was into web designing again and I did a duplicate website based on our project that I coded in html, css and javascript only without the .ASP and without the database. Just press the button bellow to check it out.

            <h2>Coding is Fun</h2>
            
            <p>I think that coding and designing is very challenging that's why just a few people knows how to code. People nowadays don't like challenges anymore.

            <h2>History</h2>
            
            <p>The birth of browsers that could display images was the first step into web design as we know it. The closest option available to structure information was the concept of tables already existing in HTML. So putting tables within tables, figuring out clever ways to mix static cells with fluid cells was the thing, started by David's Siegel's book Creating Killer Sites. Though it didnâ€™t feel totally right since...

            <p>Because I was really behind on new html and css coding techniques, I decided to teach myself how to code in web designing again. So far, I am enjoying a bunch since it's already our term break so I don't have much to do these days so I'm learning again and hope to continue learning a lot more in web designing. Here's a sample of one of my websites. It's a bit new so I was not able to put a lot of content on that site yet.
